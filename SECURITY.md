# Security Policy

## How to get security fixes

Security fixes for customers without a support contract are ONLY applied to the
master branch and delivered as part of the regular release cycle.

If you want a security fix for a released version you will need a support
contract, please contact us at sales@manorrock.com for more details.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send an email to siamese-security-issue@manorrock.com describing the issue
(preferably with a reproducer and/or a fix).
